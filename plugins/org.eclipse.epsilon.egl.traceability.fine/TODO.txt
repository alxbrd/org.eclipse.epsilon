- Features
-- Fix accuracy of trace for INESS example
--- TDD EglContext#appendToFineGrainedTrace and the TraceCombiner

-- Tracing for [% out.print("abc") %] and similar statements
--- Remove duplication between PrintOperationExecution and OutputBufferOperationContributor
--- Delete PrintOperationExecution?
--- Should OutputBuffer just implement Printer, rather than use OutputBufferPrintAdaptor?
--- Should other operations of OutputBuffer be implemented with contributors, to help modularise the class?

-- Add ability to extract trace model from ANT Task
-- Is the trace accurate when @template operations are used?
-- How to deal with model locations that are not EMF models?
-- Decide what to do with old traceability code


- Refactorings / review
-- Speak to Dimitris about passing AST to contributed operations: review the current solution.
--- I added this to allow traceability for explicit "out.print". See ExplicitPrintsShouldContributeToTrace
-- Speak to Dimitris about tracing property accesses with EMC: review the current solution.
