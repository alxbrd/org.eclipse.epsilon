\subsection{Model Storing Task}
The \textit{StoreModelTask (epsilon.storeModel)} is used to store a model residing in the project repository. The \textit{StoreModelTask} defines two attributes. The \textit{name} attribute specifies the name of the model to be stored and the \textit{target} attribute specifies the location where the model will be stored. The \textit{target} attribute is optional and if it is not defined, the model is stored in the location from which it was originally loaded.
