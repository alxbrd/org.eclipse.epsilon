\subsection{Model-to-Text Transformation Task}
\label{sec:EglTask}
To support model to text transformations, \textit{EglTask (epsilon.egl)} task is provided that executes an Epsilon Generation Language (EGL) module\footnote{As discussed in Section \ref{sec:EGL} EGL has been built atop Epsilon with a minimal contribution of the author}. In addition to the attributes defined by \textit{ExecutableModuleTask}, \textit{EglTask} also defines a \textit{target} attribute that defines where the path of the file where the generated text will be stored.
